# Draft Message Workflow

Execute these steps IN ORDER. Complete each step fully and show the required OUTPUT before moving to the next step.

---

## Step 1: Understand the Request

Ask:

> **Who's this message for and what's the goal?**
> - Recipient: (Person, team, or channel)
> - Medium: (Slack, email, Loom script, etc.)
> - Goal: (What do you want them to do/know/feel?)
> - Key points: (What must be included?)
> - Tone: (Casual, formal, direct, warm?)

**STOP and wait for answers before proceeding.**

## Step 2: Load Context

Based on the recipient, pull relevant context:

**For team members:** Read `second-brain/team.md` for their role and context.
**For clients:** Ask for client context or check inbox.
**For company-wide:** Read `second-brain/company.md` for mission/values alignment.

**OUTPUT required before proceeding:**
```
📋 Context loaded

**To:** [Recipient]
**Medium:** [Slack/Email/etc.]
**Goal:** [What to achieve]
**Tone:** [How it should feel]
**Context:** [Relevant background from files]
```

---

## Step 3: Draft the Message

Create a draft following these principles:
- Concise and direct
- Warm but professional
- Clear call-to-action if needed
- No unnecessary fluff

**OUTPUT required before proceeding:**

```
📝 **Draft Message**

**To:** [Recipient]
**Subject/Topic:** [If email or titled message]

---

[Draft message here]

---

**Word count:** [X]
**Reading time:** [X seconds/minutes]
```

---

## Step 4: Review Options

Offer alternatives if helpful:

**OUTPUT required before proceeding:**

```
✏️ **Options:**

**Option A (Current):** [Brief description — e.g., "Direct and brief"]

**Option B:** [Alternative approach — e.g., "More context upfront"]
[Show alternative draft if significantly different]

**Option C:** [Another angle if relevant]

Which direction feels right? Or should I adjust something specific?
```

**STOP and wait for feedback.**

---

## Step 5: Refine

If changes are requested, revise and show:

**OUTPUT required:**
```
📝 **Revised Draft**

---

[Updated message]

---

**Changes made:** [What was adjusted]
```

Repeat until approved.

---

## Step 6: Finalize

Once approved:

**OUTPUT required:**

```
✅ **Message ready**

**To:** [Recipient]
**Medium:** [Slack/Email/etc.]

---

[Final message — easy to copy]

---

Options:
- [ ] Save to outbox/drafts/[filename].md?
- [ ] Ready to send? (You send manually)
- [ ] Need anything else for this message?
```

**STOP and wait for response.**

## Voice Guide

When drafting, aim for:

**Good writing style:**
- Starts with the point, not the preamble
- Uses "I" and "we" naturally
- Short paragraphs, often 1-2 sentences
- Direct but not cold
- Shows appreciation genuinely, not performatively
- Asks clear questions when needed
- Ends with clear next step or CTA

**Avoid:**
- Corporate speak ("per my last email", "circle back", "synergize")
- Overly formal openings ("I hope this email finds you well")
- Passive voice when active is clearer
- Unnecessary hedging ("I was just wondering if maybe...")
